# Optionals - (2 of 3) 

* [  ] Add a detail view for one of the files and implement favoriting the file.
* I ended up leaving these more static. I could have implemented [NSUserDefaults](http://www.codingexplorer.com/nsuserdefaults-a-swift-introduction/) 
* [x] Add UITextFields for the forms so you can actually type in them and handle dismissing the keyboard.
* Got most of these set up. Even adjusted the background screenshots a bit.
* [x] You should be able to swipe through the welcome screens instead of just tapping them.
